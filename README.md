# pythonml

Repository containing various python machine learning modules. Several of the modules have corresponding blog plosts on my website: [https://nicholastsmith.wordpress.com/](https://nicholastsmith.wordpress.com/).

## bprop.py

A straightforward impelementation of the backpropagation algorithm for MLP networks. [See this blog post](https://nicholastsmith.wordpress.com/2016/03/27/multi-layer-perceptrons-and-backpropagation-a-derivation-and-implementation-in-python/) for more information.

## TFANN.py

A neural network module containing implementations of MLP, and CNN networks in TensorFlow. The classes in the module adhere to the scikit-learn fit, predict, score interface.

## TheanoANN.py

A neural network module containing implementations of MLP networks in Theano. The classes in the module adhere to the scikit-learn fit, predict, score interface.

## StockPredictor.py

A class for predicting stock price based on historical data. [See this blog post](https://nicholastsmith.wordpress.com/2016/11/04/stock-market-prediction-in-python-part-2/) for more information.
